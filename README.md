Easy enough.  Read the script, fill in what's needed, and run it.

Both of these scripts work for me on a RPi5 host in a python venv. -Apr 1 2025 (not a joke)-

To do:

~~1) Add a function to parse a list of servers to run the commands across the environment.~~

~~2) Add a script (ssh2.py) for using a bastion host.~~

3) Add a function to ensure data can only be read.  There will be no writing to the server(s).
